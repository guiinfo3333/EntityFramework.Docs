# Compare EF Core & EF6

Entity Framework is an object-relational mapper (O/RM) for .NET. This article compares the two versions: Entity Framework 6 and Entity Framework Core.

## Entity Framework 6

Entity Framework 6 (EF6) is a tried and tested data access technology. It was first released in 2008, as part of .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 and Visual Studio 2008 SP1. Starting with the 4.1 release it has shipped as the [EntityFramework](https://www.nuget.org/packages/EntityFramework/) NuGet package. EF6 runs on the .NET Framework 4.x and .NET Core from 3.0 onwards.

EF6 continues to be a supported product, and will continue to see bug fixes and minor improvements.

## Entity Framework Core

Entity Framework Core (EF Core) is a complete rewrite of EF6 that was first released in 2016. It ships in Nuget packages, the main one being [Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore/). EF Core is a cross-platform product that runs on .NET Core.

EF Core was designed to provide a developer experience similar to EF6. Most of the top-level APIs remain the same, so EF Core will feel familiar to developers who have used EF6.

## Feature comparison

EF Core offers new features that won't be implemented in EF6 (such as [alternate keys](xref:core/modeling/alternate-keys), [batch updates](xref:core/what-is-new/ef-core-1.0#relational-batching-of-statements), and [mixed client/database evaluation in LINQ queries](xref:core/querying/client-eval). But because it's a new code base, it also lacks some features that EF6 has.

The following tables compare the features available in EF Core and EF6. It's a high-level comparison and doesn't list every feature or explain differences between the same feature in different EF versions.

The EF Core column indicates the product version in which the feature first appeared.

## Guidance for new applications

Consider using EF Core for a new application if both of the following conditions are true:
* The app needs the capabilities of .NET Core. For more information, see [Choosing between .NET Core and .NET Framework for server apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/choosing-core-framework-server).
* EF Core supports all of the features that the app requires. If a desired feature is missing, check the [EF Core Roadmap](xref:core/what-is-new/index) to find out if there are plans to support it in the future. 

Consider using EF6 if both of the following conditions are true:
* The app will run on Windows and the .NET Framework 4.0 or later.
* EF6 supports all of the features that the app requires.

## Guidance for existing EF6 applications

Because of the fundamental changes in EF Core, we do not recommend moving an EF6 application to EF Core unless there is a compelling reason to make the change. If you want to move to EF Core to use new features, make sure you're aware of its limitations. For more information, see [Porting from EF6 to EF Core](porting/index.md). **The move from EF6 to EF Core is more a port than an upgrade.**
